Hello! This is the repository for my personal Website/E-portfolio.

I started this project so I can have an online presence which displays information about me! 
I went out of my way to teach myself areas of computer science which the curriculum of 
my major at the Rochester Institute of Technology does not cover. This includes implementation of 
HTML and CSS abilities, which I tacked by employing AstroHTML and TailwindCSS as frameworks for this project.
