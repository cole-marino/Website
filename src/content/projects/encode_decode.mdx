description: |
  This project was part of my Mechanics of Programming course (CS243) while studying at the Rochester Institute of Technology. 
  The goal of this project was to employ bitwise operators in the programming language C in order to encode and decode text perfectly. 
  Overall, I did great on this project, with a grade which proves it. 

  To this day, the language of C is still one of my top three favorite languages - especially the aspects of memory management and optimization.
