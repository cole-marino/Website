  This is a group project for my Principles of Data Management course at the Rochester Institute of Technology.
  The aim of this project was to provide us with practical experience with making a database and implementing a command-line
  user interface to get, insert, update, and delete data from the database. 
  My group was assigned creating a database of books, which also contains user, author, publisher, editor, followings, and book list data.
