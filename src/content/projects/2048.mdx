  This was a final project for my AP Computer Science A course which I took in 10th grade during my time at Berlin High School.
  I went above and beyond the expectations of this course by implementing a fully functional GUI employing Java Applets and keyboard inputs.
  This project was truly the catalyst for my interest in the field of Computer Science and everything about it - especially the aspects of going out on my own to 
  learn something new not because I had to, but because I wanted to. Although this project is extremely simple, it is a testament to what I have developed into a profession.
