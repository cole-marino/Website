Periodically during the end of my 2023 Summer, I started working on improving my online presence by creating this website in my free time. Taking inspiration from various websites and e-portfolios, I started researching and breaking ground on this project. I decided to implement AstroJS, which is a modern all-in-one web development framework which uses server-side rendering - resulting in amazing speed.
