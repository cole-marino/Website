  At the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic, similar to many, I had much more free time to spend indoors behind the computer.
  It was at this time when I gained a strong interest for rendering and world generation algorithms. 
  This new interest was the catalyst to experimenting with an extremely basic version of the video game MineCraft using Java in conjunction with various rendering packages.
  
  Although this project may be extremely experimental, it is a true testament to my dedication to the field of Computer Science.
