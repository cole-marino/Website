  It was at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic when I gained a strong interest for rendering and world generation algorithms. 
  This new interest was the catalyst to experimenting with an extremely basic version of the video game MineCraft using Java in conjunction with various packages 
    such as Light Weight Java Game Library 3 (LWJGL3) and OpenGL.
  
  Although this project may be extremely experimental, it is a true testament to my dedication to the field of Computer Science.
